just some of my notes

## String table

get decompressed string table by using `binwalk -Xe string_table_dump`
dump from address in idb

0x1F098
compressed size: 1260


if you want the idb open an issue with your email and i'll send it. it's a good starting point if you want to re-write the exploit.
